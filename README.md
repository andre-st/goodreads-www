# Andr√©'s Goodreads Toolbox as a Service

## Copiers

You need to change email addresses (datakadabra@gmail.com) in _all_ files, and the Google Analytics code in index.html


## About
- [responsive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design), transactional [landing page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landing_page)
- right side of the page: minimal design form
- left side of the page: slightly animated slides helping the user to understand the form
  - where do I find the needed input data and how does the service or notifications mails look like 
  - slides change when users changes input controls


## Current

The color scheme and typography is now more like the Goodreads.com website I refer to with the service.
