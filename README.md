# Andr√©'s Goodreads Toolbox as a Service

## Copiers

You need to search-replace my email address datakadabra@gmail.com in _all_ files, and my Google Analytics code in index.html


## Basic ideas
- [responsive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design), transactional [landing page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landing_page)
- right side of the page:
  - minimal design form 
  - problem and solution statement 
- left side of the page: 
  - slightly animated slides help users understand the form
  - where do they find the info they have to input and how does the service or notifications mail look like 
  - slides change when the user changes between the input controls
  - slides are actually HTML and not real screenshots or images (CSS rotation etc only gives the impression); I found this easier to update


## Current

The color scheme and typography is now more like the Goodreads.com website I refer to with the service.
