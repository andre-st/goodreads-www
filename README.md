## The landing page

[Responsive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design), [static](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page), transactional [landing page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landing_page) I can easily host on _GitHub Pages_:
- form submission is supported by external free services, plain HTML5 form validation
- form contains as less elements as possible, so filling of this form seems like less work
- color scheme and typography refer to the Goodreads.com website
- problem statement (why) -> solution statement -> call to action
- [privacy notice](privacy.txt) and consent checkbox (GDPR)
- left half of the page: slightly animated informative slides 
- slides help users understand the form: where do they find the info they have to enter etc
- slides change when the user changes between the input controls
- slides aren't real screenshots: HTML easier to update, loads faster;<br>screenshots need editing due to copyrighted book covers
