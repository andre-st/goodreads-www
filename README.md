# Andr√©'s Goodreads Toolbox as a Service

## The landing page

![Screenshot](screenshot-20180402.jpg "Screenshot")

- [responsive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design), transactional [landing page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landing_page)
- [static](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page) website so I can easily host this on GitHub
- form submission is supported by external free services
- color scheme and typography refer to the Goodreads.com website

Right half of the page: _Interaction_
- minimal design form: as less text and controls as possible 
- problem and solution statement 
- [privacy notice](privacy.txt) and consent checkbox (GDPR)
  
Left half of the page: _Information_
- slightly animated slides 
- help users understand the form on the right side:
  - where do they find the info they have to enter 
  - how does the service or notifications mail look like 
- slides change when the user changes between the input controls
- slides are actually HTML and not real screenshots: 
  - I found this easier to update
  - fonts scale better
  - page loads faster
  - screenshots need editing due to copyrighted book covers
