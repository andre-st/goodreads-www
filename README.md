## The landing page

([visit website](https://andre-st.github.io/goodreads/))

[Responsive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design), [static](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page), [transactional landing page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landing_page) I can easily host on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for free to offer my [toolbox](https://github.com/andre-st/goodreads/) to people who don't want to install anything on their own computers:
- form submission is supported by external free services
- plain HTML5 form validation
- form contains as less elements as possible, so filling of this form seems like less work
- color scheme and typography refer to the Goodreads.com website
- problem statement (why) -> solution statement -> call to action
- [privacy notice](privacy.txt) and consent checkbox (GDPR)
- left half of the page: slightly animated informative slides 
- slides 
  - change when the user changes between the input controls
  - help users understand the form: where do they find the info they have to enter etc
  - add a second mouse pointer as users are used to seek and follow mouse pointers: we attract and lead their attention to specific areas; it clearly represents an user interaction, too: "sth. you have to do too"; it's the only significant animation on the page
  - aren't real screenshots: HTML easier to update, loads faster;<br>screenshots need editing due to copyrighted book covers
  - it looks nice, reminds of a screen recording (or monitor recording if some perspective added)

### Observations:

- most subscribers don't use a special-purpose shelf with selected books but paste their whole "read" or "wishlist" shelves
- some users subscribe multiple times with different shelves so that each is checked (could be achieved with a single special-purpose shelf too); one user replied 'unsubscribe' on a mail (1 mail per shelf) and only meant to unsubscribe this specific shelf, not the other ones
- technical 'lessons learned' can be found in the comments of the source files

## Copiers

You need to search-replace my email address datakadabra@gmail.com in _all_ files.
Maybe I will generalize this webpage to a template where form and slides are easer to customize.
